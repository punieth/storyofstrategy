1. Problem Statement (1–2 lines)

For NRIs and remote owners, Urban Company makes it easy to book a service, but hard to reliably coordinate that service across multiple people (parents, tenants, neighbours) and to know what actually happened without being physically present.

So the core problem isn’t “I don’t trust the cleaner”; it’s:

“I can’t orchestrate, monitor, and audit home services remotely when multiple people are involved.”

That’s a distinct lens from NoBroker.

⸻

2. User Personas

High-level personas relevant to Urban Company:
	1.	Single Working Professional (India)
	•	Age: 23–32, Tier-1 city, mid income.
	•	Goal: Quick, reliable one-off services (cleaning, AC repair, salon).
	•	Pain: Time-poor, hates negotiation, wants one-tap booking.
	2.	Joint Family Household Manager
	•	Age: 30–50, usually woman managing house.
	•	Goal: Recurring services, predictable quality, minimal follow-up.
	•	Pain: Coordinating with spouse, elders, kids, and staff; rescheduling.
	3.	Remote Homeowner / NRI (Primary Persona for this teardown)
	•	Age: 28–45, working in US/UK/ME, property in India (parents/tenants living there or vacant).
	•	Goal:
	•	Maintain property & appliances remotely.
	•	Take care of parents’ house without making them chase vendors.
	•	Avoid crises (leaks, AC breakdowns, pest infestations).
	•	Pain:
	•	Must rely on parents/tenants/neighbours for access, supervision, feedback.
	•	Can’t see what actually happened during/after service.
	•	Hard to track who booked what, when, and whether it was done well.
	4.	Tenant / Paying Guest (Linked Persona)
	•	Age: 20–35, renting, may or may not pay for services themselves.
	•	Goal: Get things fixed without friction with owner.
	•	Pain: Awkward negotiation over “who pays” and approvals.
	5.	Service Professional / Partner (Supply-side)
	•	Age: 25–40, on-ground cleaner/technician.
	•	Goal: Maximise completed jobs, reduce cancellations, get fair ratings.
	•	Pain: Waiting around when no one opens the door, owner unreachable, disputes.

⸻

3. Prioritised Persona

Per your guideline: large audience + highly impacted.

We pick:

Remote Homeowner / NRI managing property and/or parents’ home in India.

Why this is a good choice:
	•	Impact is high: one bad service → real financial & emotional damage (broken appliance, mistrust, argument with parents/tenant).
	•	Person is willing to pay a premium for orchestration, not just service price.
	•	Persona differentiates your portfolio from Indian-only PMs.

Everything else in the teardown centres this persona.

⸻

4. Detailed User Journey Mapping

(for NRI homeowner managing parents’ house or rented property)

I’ll break this into stages and call out where multi-actor dependency appears.

Stage 1 – Trigger & Need Recognition
	•	AC not cooling / water leakage / deep cleaning needed / pest issue.
	•	Who notices? Usually parent/tenant in India, not the NRI.
	•	They ping the NRI on WhatsApp / call at odd hours: “Something is wrong, we need to call someone.”

Pain:
	•	NRI gets fragmented, emotional descriptions (“AC is not working at all”) with low technical clarity.
	•	No shared space to track issues: things live in WhatsApp threads.

⸻

Stage 2 – Decision: Use Urban Company (or not)
	•	NRI suggests: “Let’s book on Urban Company.”
	•	One of three flows happens:
	1.	NRI books from abroad, entering the Indian address and parent’s phone as contact.
	2.	Parent/tenant books directly on their phone.
	3.	They don’t use UC because parents distrust apps / fear scams → revert to “known local guy.”

Pain:
	•	Ambiguity over who owns the booking:
	•	If NRI books, parent may not see notifications.
	•	If parent books, NRI may not see charges or details.
	•	No explicit role definitions like “payer”, “on-site contact”, “approver.”

⸻

Stage 3 – Booking & Time Coordination
	•	Slots chosen based on India time.
	•	NRI must coordinate with:
	•	Parent’s health/availability.
	•	Tenant’s schedule.
	•	Society entry rules (gate pass, ID, etc).

Pain:
	•	Last-minute schedule changes are common (doctor visits, festivals, work).
	•	Rescheduling requires whoever booked to act – others can’t easily adjust.
	•	If the job is cancelled or marked “customer not available,” NRI often hears about it after it has failed.

⸻

Stage 4 – Service Execution (Day Of)
	•	UC partner arrives; interacts with whoever is at home (parent/tenant/helper).
	•	Partner may call the registered phone number; if that’s the NRI, wrong time-zone calls get missed.
	•	Execution quality is judged by local person (“seems okay”) and indirectly fed back to NRI.

Pain:
	•	Broken communication triangle:
	•	Partner ↔ On-site person ↔ Remote owner.
	•	Important decisions (extra parts, upsell, extra work) are forced in real-time with poor context:
	•	“Should we replace this part for ₹3,500?” – parent doesn’t know; NRI is unreachable.
	•	No structured way to capture before/after evidence or checklist completion; only ad-hoc photos on WhatsApp.

⸻

Stage 5 – Payment, Rating, and Documentation
	•	Payment may be:
	•	Online by NRI using saved card.
	•	Cash / UPI by parent/tenant.
	•	Ratings & feedback are usually given by whoever has the UC login (not necessarily the one who paid or is most impacted).

Pain:
	•	Financial opacity: NRI often doesn’t know final amount paid, discounts, or extras taken.
	•	Rating distortion: A polite parent gives 5★ even if work is mediocre → undermines future matching/quality.
	•	Documentation gap: No simple place to see:
	•	What was fixed
	•	Which parts replaced
	•	Warranty/guarantee terms
	•	Next recommended service date

⸻

Stage 6 – Post-Service Issues & Long-Term Relationship
	•	AC leaks again / pest problem recurs / cleaning not up to mark.
	•	On-ground person complains: “That company you booked did not do it properly.”
	•	NRI must now:
	•	Dig out job details,
	•	Check eligibility for free revisit,
	•	Coordinate once more with same multi-actor setup.

Pain:
	•	Accountability blur: It’s not clear if UC, the partner, or the tenant misused/ignored instructions.
	•	Memory overload: No simple way to view history of services at this property across months/years.
	•	Opportunity cost: NRI begins to feel UC is “not worth the hassle” and reverts to local informal networks.

⸻

5. Consolidated Pain Points

Let’s distil the journey into discrete pain points for the NRI persona:
	1.	P1 – No Role-Based Access or Shared Ownership
	•	System assumes a single user; reality = owner + on-site contact + sometimes tenant.
	•	Roles (payer, scheduler, approver, reviewer) are not modeled.
	2.	P2 – Fragmented Communication Across Apps & People
	•	WhatsApp for context + UC for booking + calls/SMS for partner → no single timeline.
	•	Owner can’t reconstruct “what actually happened” without manual effort.
	3.	P3 – Low Transparency During Execution
	•	No structured “live” view for remote owner: technician arrival, progress, issues needing approval.
	•	Crucial decisions made via ad-hoc calls with the least-informed person.
	4.	P4 – Poor Post-Service Audit & Documentation
	•	Lack of standardised checklists, before/after evidence, and parts history.
	•	Hard to track warranty, next due service, and recurring failure patterns.
	5.	P5 – Service History is Not Property-Centric
	•	History is user-account-centric, not property-centric.
	•	For NRIs with multiple properties or changing tenants, knowledge doesn’t “live with the house.”

⸻

6. Prioritising Pain Points

(Single framework: Impact × Frequency × Strategic Fit)

We’ll use one simple scoring model:
	•	Impact: How severely it affects NRI perceived value of UC.
	•	Frequency: How often it appears across common service types.
	•	Strategic Fit: How aligned it is with UC’s ambition to be a “full-stack home services platform.”

Score each 1–5; multiply for rough prioritisation.

Pain	Impact	Frequency	Strategic Fit	Score	Notes
P1 – No role-based access	5	4	5	100	Core to multi-actor reality; blocks advanced use cases.
P2 – Fragmented comms	4	5	4	80	Constant friction; quick wins possible.
P3 – Low transparency during execution	4	3	4	48	High emotional value, medium frequency.
P4 – Poor post-service audit	3	4	4	48	Important for long-term retention, less immediate.
P5 – Property-centric history missing	3	3	5	45	Strategic, but slower payoff, more infra.

Top 3 (“Big 3”) pain points to focus on:
	1.	P1 – No Role-Based Access / Shared Ownership
	2.	P2 – Fragmented Communication & Timeline
	3.	P3 – Low Transparency During Execution

These three together define the “multi-actor workflow problem” you wanted to focus on.
They’re also clearly differentiated from NoBroker’s “trust in strangers” problem.

⸻

7. Solution Directions (Ok / Good / Moonshot)

We’re not writing the full PRD yet, but you need some solution thinking in the teardown per your mentor’s template.

For each of the Big 3 pains:

P1 – No Role-Based Access / Shared Ownership
	•	OK Idea:
	•	Allow adding a “Secondary Contact” per booking with phone + name.
	•	Both receive SMS/WhatsApp and can see status.
	•	Good Idea:
	•	Household Profiles: define roles – Owner, On-site Contact, Tenant.
	•	Each role has pre-set permissions: book, approve add-ons, leave ratings, pay.
	•	Owner can toggle who pays and who decides.
	•	Moonshot Idea:
	•	“Family / Property Workspace” where multiple stakeholders collaborate:
	•	Shared calendar of upcoming services.
	•	Role-based consent flows (e.g., tenant can request services, owner auto-approves up to a limit).

P2 – Fragmented Communication & Timeline
	•	OK Idea:
	•	In-app “Notes for professional” and “Internal notes for household” fields visible to all.
	•	Automatic import of key WhatsApp messages via deep links.
	•	Good Idea:
	•	Unified Service Timeline for each job: creation, reschedules, arrival, work start, extra cost approvals, completion, payment.
	•	Timeline visible to owner + on-site contact + partner.
	•	Moonshot Idea:
	•	Service Feed for Each Property: like a Slack channel:
	•	Every job and message shows up as events.
	•	Owners can @mention members (“@Dad please confirm AC noise issue here”).

P3 – Low Transparency During Execution
	•	OK Idea:
	•	Require partner to upload at least 2 photos (before/after) and tick a checklist (“filter cleaned”, “gas level checked”).
	•	Good Idea:
	•	Live Status for Remote Owner:
	•	“Technician en route → On-site → Work in progress → Waiting for approval → Completed”.
	•	Push notification + summary at the end.
	•	Moonshot Idea:
	•	Remote Approval Flow:
	•	When partner suggests an extra paid task, the app shows a structured estimate.
	•	Owner can approve/decline in app; on-site person just observes.

You’ll later pick a subset of these to turn into a concrete MVP + PRD. For now, this satisfies the “solutions space” requirement without bloating into full PRD.

⸻

8. MVP Direction (high level, not full spec)

Given the prioritisation:

MVP Theme: “Multi-Actor Job Flow for Remote Owners”

Single sentence:

Launch a lightweight multi-actor booking and tracking flow that lets an NRI owner assign an on-site contact, share a unified timeline, and receive structured proof of work – without changing UC’s core service model.

MVP bundle (so you don’t violate “< 2 weeks build” spirit):
	1.	Add Roles at Booking: Owner can add On-Site Contact with phone + relationship (Parent / Tenant / Neighbour).
	2.	Shared Status Timeline: Both owner and contact see basic status: Booked → Partner Assigned → En Route → On-site → Completed.
	3.	Mandatory Before/After Evidence: Photo + checklist attached at completion, visible to both.

We’ll turn this into a clean PRD later.

⸻

9. Success Metrics (max 3)

Don’t scatter metrics. Pick the few that prove the workflow thesis.
	1.	% of Bookings with Multi-Actor Setup
	•	(# bookings where an additional contact is added) / (total bookings from NRI/“remote owner” cluster).
	•	Shows adoption of the new model.
	2.	Drop in “Customer Not Available / No-Show” Cancellations
	•	Cancellations due to unavailability among multi-actor bookings vs control.
	•	If coordination improves, this should fall.
	3.	Repeat Booking Rate from Identified NRI Accounts / Remote Properties
	•	of second booking within 90 days from same property/owner.
	•	Direct measure of “this feels manageable to run remotely”.

You can mention secondary qualitative measures later (NPS, CSAT) but don’t overload the teardown.

⸻

10. Go-To-Market Strategy (high level, includes in-product assets)

Remember the guideline: GTM ≠ just emails. You must use in-product assets.

Initial Users of the MVP
	•	Primary:
	•	Users who frequently book services at addresses different from their current GPS location / SIM country.
	•	Users whose contact number is foreign (+1, +44, +971) but address is in India.
	•	Secondary:
	•	Power users in India who manage parents’ homes or rental properties (multiple addresses in one account).

How You’ll Launch (Channels & Assets)
	1.	In-App Surfaces
	•	Booking screen: subtle nudge – “Add on-site contact (family/tenant) so they also get updates.”
	•	Post-booking screen: “Share this booking with your family member” CTA.
	•	Property page: “Turn this house into a ‘Family Home’ – add members.”
	2.	Lifecycle Comms
	•	Email & Push to:
	•	Users with multiple properties.
	•	Users whose past bookings had “customer not available” issues.
	•	Message: “No more coordinating 3 people on WhatsApp – manage everything from one shared view.”
	3.	In-Product Education
	•	Short explainer gif/illustration in help centre & onboarding carousel showing Owner ↔ Parent ↔ Partner flow.
	4.	Measurement Loop
	•	A/B test with properties tagged as “remote managed” vs control to prove value before broad rollout.

This respects the guideline about in-product GTM, not just external campaigns.

Great — let’s sharpen the teardown with more accurate language and concrete citations. I’ll adjust the parts where we reference what Urban Company already does, what it lacks from the NRI-multi-actor perspective, and bolster with research to support those claims.

Updated Teardown (refined)

Problem Statement
For NRIs or remote homeowners managing a property in India, Urban Company makes booking a service possible but does *not provide a fluent workflow for orchestrating that service across multiple stakeholders (owner abroad → on-site contact → tenant/helper) nor a unified view of what actually happened.

Personas
Primary Persona: Remote Homeowner / NRI
	•	Lives abroad, property in India (with parents or tenants).
	•	Needs to coordinate service jobs remotely, with minimal on-site time.
	•	Goal: Maintain property, minimise friction & risk, without being physically present.
	•	Key pain: Lack of visibility, fragmented coordination, role ambiguity (“Who books? Who pays? Who supervises?”).

Secondary Persona: On-Site Contact (Parent/ Tenant)
	•	Lives at property.
	•	May not use app.
	•	Interface with worker and NRI, but lacks decision/payer authority.
	•	Pain: Having to relay info, no clarity on job status or cost.

Tertiary Persona: Worker/Partner
	•	Executes job.
	•	Interface optimized for one customer booking, not multiple decision-makers.

What Urban Company Already Does (with citations)
	•	Onboarding and verification of workers: The research study notes Urban Company’s very extensive worker onboarding (ID docs, bank details, uniforms, training).  ￼
	•	Verification & monitoring tools: The study describes features like OTP verification, photographs, checklists used to monitor worker performance.  ￼
	•	App tracks booking lifecycle from customer viewpoint (booking, partner assignment, service execution). The research details the 5-stage flow: onboarding, booking, completing task, grievance, finances.  ￼
	•	Supports multiple addresses for bookings (publicly visible in app store screenshots). Though this is address‐centric, not necessarily actor‐centric.

Gap: What It Doesn’t Handle Well for Persona B
(remote owner / multi-actor scenario)

Gap	Evidence / Reasoning
Role-based access and shared ownership	The research states: “the people booking a service on their platform as the primary users of the application”.  ￼  There is no mention in public material of “add a co‐owner contact”, “tenant can approve”, “shared timeline for multiple contacts”.
Unified communication & timeline across actors	While UC offers chat between customer and worker, there is no documented “household workspace” or shared timeline (owner abroad, parent on site, worker) in public research. The study focuses on customer & partner roles only.  ￼
Remote‐owner transparency during execution	There is monitoring of workers via photos/checklists, but the research frames these as internal compliance tools rather than features designed for the remote owner.  ￼  For the remote homeowner, there is no documented “before/after job report”, “progress updates”, or “approve extra work” workflow in public documentation.
Property-centric service history and analytics	Public studies and docs focus on job‐level flows, not property‐level dashboards (especially across bookings). The remote owner managing multiple properties would benefit from aggregated view, but no evidence this is provided.

Why These Gaps Matter (Risks & Opportunity)
	•	Because the app is optimized for one actor (customer on-site), remote owners face coordination friction, visibility blind spots, and role ambiguity, which increase risk (wrong work, miscommunication, payment disputes) and reduce willingness to use UC for their scenario.
	•	This creates an opportunity for UC (or a feature set within it) to unlock a premium segment of NRIs/property-owners who might pay more for “remote orchestration” rather than just “on-demand service”. For you as a PM this is the lever: show strategy + systems thinking.
	•	If UC does not solve this, competitors might (or a startup might), making this a strategic gap.

Prioritised Pain Points (refined)
	1.	P1 – Lack of explicit role-based multi-actor workflow (owner, on-site contact, tenant)
	2.	P2 – Fragmented communication & missing shared timeline
	3.	P3 – Transparency gap for remote owner during execution

These remain the top three based on impact for the NRI persona.

Solution Directions (brief summary)
	•	For P1: Household profile with roles, permissions; ability to add contacts via booking; owner pays, on-site contact coordinates.
	•	For P2: Service timeline visible to owner + onsite contact + worker; in-app notes for each actor; property feed.
	•	For P3: Live status updates, before/after photos/checklist delivered to all actors; in-app snapshot of job result; optional “approve extra cost” by owner.

Success Metrics (adjusted)
	•	Adoption: % of bookings where owner adds an on-site contact.
	•	Coordination efficiency: % reduction in “customer not available / cancelled” cases for bookings flagged as remote-managed (owner abroad).
	•	Retention: % of remote-owner flagged properties that rebook within 90 days.

Go-to-Market (adjusted)
	•	Identify “remote managed properties” segment: owners with Indian address, overseas phone number, or multiple addresses in account.
	•	In-app nudge: “Add your local contact (parent/tenant) to get updates and relieve hassle”.
	•	Email/Push to remote owners: share family view feature with testimonial: “See what happened while you were on Zoom call”
	•	Internally tag early adopters; gather qualitative feedback to iterate quickly.

⸻

Why This Works for Your Portfolio
	•	It complements your previous teardown (NoBroker) by shifting from trust in peer transactions to orchestration of service ecosystems.
	•	You show you are thinking for global → local Indian context (NRIs) — a differentiated viewpoint in the Bangalore PM market.
	•	You operate at a systems layer (roles, timelines, dashboards) not just “feature + UI”, which is the strategic depth recruiters look for.
	•	You ground your critique in public research about Urban Company’s existing model—which makes your argument credible, not speculative.

⸻

If you like, I can now generate the full PRD for the selected solution bundle (let’s pick “Household Profile + Shared Service Timeline”) — will include: detailed user flows, feature specs, UX sketches (low-fi), constraints/trade-offs, roadmap, and final success metrics.
