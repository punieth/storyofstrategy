### The Real Cost of Confusion
<p>
  Meesho's mission is to democratize e-commerce. But for millions of first-time users, a confusing refund process isn't just a hassle—it's a breach of trust that costs a fortune in support overhead and lost customers. This is where user experience directly impacts the bottom line.

### The Solution: A Radically Simple Tracker
<p>
  We don't need to reinvent the wheel. We just need to show the user
  that the wheels are turning. This is a communication feature,
  designed to replace anxiety with confidence.

### How We'll Measure Success
<div class="border-2 border-black rounded-lg p-8 my-8 border-l-4 border-blue-600 shadow-box bg-blue-100">

        Primary Goal: Reduce User Anxiety & Support Costs

        Our main KPI is a
        <b class="text-black">&gt;20% reduction in "Where is my Refund?" tickets.</b>
        This directly measures user frustration and our operational
        load.

    </li>
    <li class="pt-6 border-t-2 border-black">
      <p class="font-semibold text-lg text-blue-800">
        Secondary Goal: Build Long-Term Trust

      <p class="text-gray-700">
        We'll track
        <b class="text-black">First-Time Returner Retention.</b>
        After a user's first return, do they buy again? This shows if
        we are building long-term loyalty or just a leaky bucket.

### The Game Plan: A Disciplined MVP

    <h4 class="font-bold text-lg">
      What We're Building (The MVP)
    </h4>
    <ul class="mt-4 space-y-2 text-gray-700 list-disc list-inside">
      <li>A read-only tracker screen.</li>
      <li>One new API endpoint to expose existing backend data.</li>
      <li>
        An event-logging pipeline to feed our new metrics dashboard.
      </li>
      <li class="font-semibold text-black">
        This is a quick win. Maybe 2 sprints, tops.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="border-2 border-black rounded-lg p-6 shadow-box bg-red-200">
    <h4 class="font-bold text-lg">
      What We're *Not* Building (The Non-Goals)
    </h4>
    <ul class="mt-4 space-y-2 text-gray-700 list-disc list-inside">
      <li>NO real-time GPS courier tracking.</li>
      <li>NO in-app chat with support agents.</li>
      <li>NO ability to change refund destination.</li>
      <li class="font-semibold text-black">
        This discipline keeps us focused on the core problem.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>

### From Leaky Bucket to Growth Flywheel
<p>
  This isn't just about plugging a hole in the bucket. It's about
  turning a moment of maximum friction into a surprising moment of
  trust. A happy refund experience becomes a story Priya tells her
  sister. That story builds a brand that no amount of marketing spend
  can buy, lowering acquisition costs and building a real, defensible
  moat in India's most important consumer market.
