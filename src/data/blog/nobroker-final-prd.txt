🧩 PRD — “Quiet Mode + Verified Handshake”

0. Context

NoBroker’s brand promise — “No Brokerage. Full Control.” — has strong emotional equity among Indian homeowners.
But for NRI owners, that promise collapses within minutes of listing.

Instead of a reassuring, tech-driven experience, they are bombarded with phone calls and WhatsApp messages from unknown Indian numbers — often marked “Spam Risk.”
The same “proactive service” that feels helpful to Indian owners feels intrusive and unprofessional abroad.

This PRD translates that insight into two actionable product interventions:
	1.	Quiet Mode — Calm, consent-based communication for NRI owners.
	2.	Verified Handshake — Transparent, identity-first digital introduction for Relationship Managers (RMs).

⸻

1. Problem Statement

For NRI owners, NoBroker’s first human contact feels like chaos, not care.
	•	Immediate RM calls create trust anxiety.
	•	No visible proof of RM identity creates fear of scams.
	•	Time-zone–insensitive outreach feels disrespectful.
	•	The overall experience breaks NoBroker’s emotional promise of “independence.”

“Help feels pushy. The platform that promised freedom starts sounding like every broker I wanted to avoid.”

⸻

2. Objectives

Objective	Description	Target
Reduce early churn	Retain NRI owners during the first 72 hours	-20% churn
Improve trust signals	Make all RM interactions verifiably authentic	+15 NPS
Modernize CRM outreach	Enable consent-based communication	60% Quiet Mode adoption
Reduce spam complaints	Remove “spam risk” perception across reviews	<5% complaints


⸻

3. Key Hypothesis

If NRI owners are given calm control (Quiet Mode) and transparent identity (Verified Handshake) before human outreach, they will:
	•	Feel safer using NoBroker from abroad.
	•	Engage longer with the platform.
	•	Convert to paid services with higher intent and less cynicism.

5. Proposed Solution

A. Quiet Mode (Phase 1)

Goal: Let owners abroad control how and when NoBroker contacts them.

Core Features:
	1.	Automatic NRI Detection
	•	Detect via international phone codes or login IP.
	•	Flag account as “NRI Owner” in CRM.
	2.	Consent Modal (Post-Listing)
After posting a listing, show modal:

How would you like to hear from us?

[ ] WhatsApp Digest  
[ ] Email Only  
[ ] Call Me Later (After 72 hours)  
[ ] No Contact for 3 Days

Default: Email Only (for international accounts).

	3.	Deferred RM Assignment
	•	When Quiet Mode = ON → RM calls delayed for 72 hours.
	•	CRM displays label: “Quiet Mode Active – RM access restricted.”
	4.	Dashboard Tag
	•	Subtle label under “My Listings”:
Quiet Mode: Active until Nov 3
	•	CTA → Change Preferences
	5.	Activity Logging
	•	Events: quiet_mode_enabled, rm_contact_delayed, preference_changed.

⸻

B. Verified Handshake (Phase 2)

Goal: Build trust before voice contact.

Core Features:
	1.	Verified RM Card
	•	Push notification + in-app banner:
“You’re being contacted by Priya Sharma (Verified 🛡️ NoBroker Guide)”
	•	Includes photo, ID, location, communication options.
	2.	Trusted Pathways
	•	WhatsApp verified business chat link or email thread auto-launched.
	•	No cold call without digital verification event logged.
	3.	Change Preferences
	•	If the user taps Change Preference → Reopen Quiet Mode Modal.
	4.	Fallback Email
	•	If API fails, send email confirmation:
“Priya Sharma (Verified RM) will contact you via WhatsApp. You can verify her ID in your app.”

⸻

C. Weekly Visibility Digest (Phase 3)

Goal: Replace silence with structured reassurance.

Sample Digest Message:

“Your property got 18 views this week. Add balcony photos for 25% more visibility.
You can reach your RM, Priya, anytime via verified chat.”

7. Edge Cases & Mitigations

#	Scenario	Expected Behavior	Mitigation
1	User uses Indian SIM abroad	Quiet Mode not triggered automatically	Add IP + timezone detection

5	API delay on verified card	Fallback to email	Maintain consistent tone
6	Multiple listings per owner	Quiet Mode per listing	“Quiet Mode Active (2 of 3)”
7	Owner disables all contact	CRM label = Do Not Contact	In-app toggle to re-enable
8	Owner switches mode mid-cycle	CRM delay recalculated dynamically	Audit log updated
9	No engagement for 7 days	Trigger digest: “Want to speak to an expert?”	Non-intrusive reactivation
10	RM verification fails	Replace badge with “Pending Verification”	Allow async fix


⸻

8. UX Guidance (for Loveable.dev)

Feature	Key Screens	UX Intent
Quiet Mode Modal	Listing → Confirmation → Preference	Tone: calm, choice-driven
Dashboard Tag	Active/Inactive states	Minimal design; non-intrusive
Verified Handshake Card	Active + failure modes	Strong visual proof (🛡️ icon, verified green)
Weekly Digest	WhatsApp/Email layout	Informative, concise, reassuring

🪄 Design tone:
“Professional calm.” No bright CTAs or sales-driven copy.
Use muted colors, sans-serif typography, and whitespace to signal composure.

⸻

9. Technical Feasibility

Assumptions:
	•	CRM (Freshdesk / internal system) supports tagging and delayed queueing.
	•	RM metadata exists in central DB.
	•	WhatsApp API integration (Meta Verified Business) already active.
	•	Country detection available via phone input or IP.

Implementation Plan:

Phase	Duration	Teams	Output
Phase 1	2 weeks	FE + BE + QA	Quiet Mode MVP
Phase 2	2 weeks	CRM + FE	Verified Handshake rollout
Phase 3	1 week	Growth + Marketing	Weekly Digest
Total	5 weeks	Cross-functional	Pilot-ready release

Infra impact: Negligible (<5% traffic increase).
Use batch jobs + cached metadata for verified cards.

10. Rollout Strategy

Stage	Description	Goal
Alpha	Internal NRI test (10 users)	Validate UX tone + modal behavior
Beta	Bangalore & Pune (1K NRI users)	Measure churn delta
Launch	Expand to top 5 NRI regions	Achieve >60% opt-in
Global	UAE, US, UK, Singapore	Brand refresh campaign “Your Property, Your Peace”


⸻

11. Success Metrics

Metric	Baseline	Target	Signal
NRI spam complaints	15%	<5%	Trust
D7 retention (NRI)	55%	≥70%	Retention
Quiet Mode adoption	0%	60%	Preference
RM satisfaction	2.8	4.2	Internal alignment
Subscription conversion	2%	3%+	Monetization
NPS (NRI owners)	25	45+	Brand strength


⸻

12. Risks & Mitigations

Risk	Description	Mitigation
Low adoption	Users ignore modal	Default to “Email Only” + reminder
Misinterpretation	NRIs assume neglect due to silence	Add digest reassurance
RM resistance	Delayed contact = missed upsell	Educate via CRM pop-up: “Quiet Mode improves conversions”
Over-engineering	Complex CRM rules	Keep logic rule-based, not ML-dependent
International compliance	GDPR-like consent norms	Store explicit opt-in events


⸻

13. Final Reflection

This initiative doesn’t add features — it adds empathy.
It reframes help from urgency to intentionality.

For Indian users, speed means care.
For NRIs, calm means care.
Both can coexist if context is built into the system.

“NoBroker shouldn’t sound louder just because the owner is farther.”

Quiet Mode and Verified Handshake let NoBroker keep its promise —
“No Brokerage” now truly means “No Pressure.”
