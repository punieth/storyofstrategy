Zepto teardown → research dossier (consumer app, India)


1) Context & hypotheses (2–3)
	•	What Zepto optimizes now:
Speed as primary promise (10-min) with wide catalog expansion (electronics, pharmacy) riding recent scale/funding; “10-min everywhere” positioning is explicit in app listing and press.  ￼
Availability via dense dark-store buildout and assortment breadth; ops narrative highlights rapid pick/pack under ~1–2 minutes.  ￼
Margin via fees, private labels, and membership swap (Pass → Daily); multiple user reports flag “handling/processing/surge” add-ons; analysts note improving private-label mix.  ￼
	•	Likely failure modes in the app flow:
Pricing opacity (discounts offset by fees; device-level price variance claims) eroding trust at cart/checkout.  ￼
Post-order issues (OOS/substitutions, expired/damaged items, refund friction; Zepto Cash vs source refunds) create costly support loops and churn.  ￼
Notification fatigue / re-engagement spam generating backlash and opt-outs.  ￼

⸻

2) Voice of Customer (VoC) — recent, 1-liners clustered (quotes + links/dates)

3) Framework pass

AARRR (2–3 bullets each)
	•	Acquisition
Wins: 10-min promise; broad SKUs; frequent promos.  ￼
Gaps: Social backlash on spammy notification/SMS; negative word-of-mouth on refunds.  ￼
	•	Activation (first session → first checkout)
Wins: Fast perceived ETAs; aggressive “free cash/discounts” nudges.  ￼
Gaps: Cart math confusion (handling/processing/surge adds); device-price inconsistency claims.  ￼
	•	Retention
Wins: Category expansion (pharmacy, café) raises use-cases.  ￼
Gaps: Refund friction and quality variance drive uninstalls/churn.  ￼
	•	Revenue
Wins: Fees, private label mix, membership pivot.  ￼
Risks: Short-term ARPU boosts may trade off with LTV via trust erosion.
	•	Referral
Wins: “Wow” on speed can be shareable.
Gaps: Public threads skew negative on trust/pricing; riders’ experience stories dampen goodwill.  ￼

HEART (score 1–5; 5=best)
	•	Happiness: 3.0 — High headline rating but many 1-star refund/fee complaints.  ￼
	•	Engagement: 4.0 — Frequent orders driven by speed & category depth.  ￼
	•	Adoption: 4.5 — 100M+ installs; national expansion.  ￼
	•	Retention: 3.0 — Issues post-delivery (refunds/quality) threaten repeat use.  ￼
	•	Task success: 3.5 — Fast delivery success vs. cart/fee clarity + support access gaps.  ￼

JTBD (5–7 jobs; acceptance tests)
	1.	When I realize I’m missing a key ingredient 20 mins before cooking, I want to get it within 10 mins, so I can proceed without delaying dinner.

	3.	When I stock up weekly, I want to keep total spend predictable, so I can avoid fee surprises.
Accept: Cart total within ±₹5 of final; fees itemized upfront; no after-placement fee drift.
	4.	When an item is OOS, I want to approve/decline substitutions with control, so I can avoid unwanted products.
Accept: Pre-delivery substitution prompt with price deltas; one-tap decline.
	5.	When something goes wrong, I want to get a source refund quickly, so I can retain trust and reorder.
Accept: ≤72h refund to source (prepaid); clear status; no forced wallet unless COD.  ￼
	6.	When I’m price-sensitive, I want to compare fees vs membership in-flow, so I can choose cheapest path.
Accept: Side-by-side cost compare; transparent Pass/Daily terms.  ￼

5) Top problems (ranked 1–7)
	1.	Cart/checkout price opacity → trust erosion
Evidence: discount reversals; handling/processing/surge added later; device-price variance claims.  ￼
Suspected cause: pricing/promo engine & fee toggles applied late; experiments without clear disclosures.
Impact (hyp.): ↑order abandonment, ↓NPS, ↑support contacts; LTV↓.
Diagnostic: server logs comparing cart_total_at_confirm vs invoice_total; diff histogram by city/device; A/B disclosure copy.
	2.	Refund friction & wallet-locking
Evidence: non-delivered/defective items with denied or delayed refunds; forced Zepto Cash perceptions.  ￼
Cause: policy ambiguity, QA photo “proof” over-reliance; COD wallet constraint.  ￼
Impact: ↑churn post-incident; social complaints.
Diagnostic: cohort churn 30-day post-refund interaction; SLA vs actual TAT; % forced wallet vs source.
	3.	Quality control (expired/damaged) & weak substitution UX
Evidence: expired/damaged protein/oats; substitution control unclear.  ￼
Cause: dark-store QC variance; picker SLA pressure; limited customer approval loop.
Impact: ↑refund cost, ↓repeat rate.
Diagnostic: item-level defect rates by store; substitution acceptance/cancel rates; picker chat availability audit.
	4.	Notification/SMS spam undermines engagement
Evidence: celebrity complaint; threads on daily spam.  ￼
Cause: aggressive growth CRM, poor frequency capping; lack of promo vs transactional separation.
Impact: OS-level notification blocks; reputational hits; deliverability↓.
Diagnostic: opt-out rates; DAU change after CRM sends; push category tagging audit.
	5.	Address/geo accuracy & serviceability toggling
Evidence: longtime addresses suddenly “not serviceable”; mis-delivery to wrong address.  ￼
Cause: polygon changes, dark-store switching, geocoding drift; weak fallbacks.
Impact: lost orders, CS contacts.
Diagnostic: map boundary diffs vs last month; % orders failing at address-validation; heatmap of “not serviceable” retries.
	6.	Tipping UX timing (pre-delivery only)
Evidence: users can tip before/during but not after delivery; low tip penetration (~5%).  ￼
Cause: pre-tip bias for conversion; missing post-order nudge.
Impact: foregone rider earnings goodwill; user frustration.
Diagnostic: A/B post-delivery tip prompt; tip attach rate vs NPS.
	7.	Policy/compliance risk perception
Evidence: FDA license suspension news; workplace allegations press.  ￼
Cause: rapid scale; uneven governance.
Impact: localized outage risk; trust hit.
Diagnostic: store compliance checklist adherence rate; incident comms latency.

6) Field-test data to collect this week (1–2 small orders)

Screens / metrics to capture
	•	Onboarding & address: serviceability message; map pin vs GPS; address save/edit latency.
	•	Search/browse: #results for 5 staple queries; OOS count; category badges.
	•	PDP: stock status freshness; expiry info (pharma/FMCG); substitution hints.
	•	Cart/fees: line-item fees (delivery/handling/processing/surge), tip prompts timing; compare cart_confirm_total vs final_invoice_total (screenshot both).
	•	Coupons & payment: success/fail; wallet vs source refunds option visibility.
	•	ETA promise & tracking: promised ETA vs actual; timeline events (packed, out for delivery, delivered).
	•	Picker chat/substitutions: whether available; approval UI; price delta clarity.
	•	Order completion & refund path: raise a benign issue (e.g., short expiry); measure refund to source days; any push to wallet.
	•	Notifications cadence: capture every push/SMS from add-to-cart → 48h post-delivery; categorize promo vs transactional.
	•	Store switching: does app auto-switch store between sessions; banner disclosure.

(Optional: run same journey on Blinkit/Instamart/BB Now for baseline.)

7) PRD seed (tie to top problems) — opportunity areas (v0, no AI)

A) Upfront Price Truths (UPT)
	•	Objective: Eliminate cart→invoice drift and hidden-fee perception.
	•	Primary KPI: Δ(|invoice−confirm| ≤₹2) rate to 95%+. Guardrails: conversion not ↓ >2%.
	•	v0: Fee calculator runs before payment selection; single “Fees & Discounts” drawer with deterministic math; freeze fees post-confirm (except user-approved changes).
	•	Risks/trade-offs: Slight AOV dip; promo cannibalization.
	•	Experiment: A/B transparent fees module vs control; success if complaint rate on “fees/charges” ↓50% and checkout conversion ≥-1%.

B) Refunds That Earn Trust
	•	Objective: Source-refund reliability and visibility.
	•	KPI: % refunds to source (prepaid) within ≤72h; CS tickets/order ↓. Guardrail: refund abuse ≤ baseline.
	•	v0: Refund tracker in Order Details (timestamps, RRN); default source for prepaid; explicit COD→Zepto Cash rationale; proactive push on refund state changes.
	•	Experiment: Holdout by cities; success if NPS post-issue +8 pts, complaint volume −30%.  ￼

C) Substitution with Consent
	•	Objective: Raise user control & satisfaction on OOS.
	•	KPI: Substitution approval rate, item acceptance NPS; refunds due to wrong subs ↓.
	•	v0: Pre-dispatch one-tap approve/decline with price/brand delta; timeout default = no sub; “Always allow for X brand” preference.
	•	Experiment: A/B on top 200 SKUs; success if approval ≥40% and post-order complaints on subs −30%.

D) Respectful Re-engagement
	•	Objective: Reduce spam perception while preserving revenue.
	•	KPI: Push opt-out rate ↓30%; CTR stable (±5%); complaint mentions on spam ↓.
	•	v0: Frequency caps by category; promo vs transactional channels separated; quiet hours; easy in-app controls surfaced in Profile.
	•	Experiment: Ramp by cohorts; success if opt-out ↓ and DAU unaffected.

⸻

8) What NOT to do now
	•	No wireframes, no full PRD narrative, no design polish.
	•	Don’t widen scope to partner/ops tooling.
	•	Don’t add AI-assist features; fix fundamentals first (price clarity, refunds, substitutions, CRM caps).

⸻

Competitive & market context quick notes
	•	Funding & expansion pressure: $450M raise at $7B; plan to add “several hundred” dark stores; expect promo pressure & cash burn — intensifies fee/promo experimentation that drives user distrust if opaque.  ￼
	•	Category creep: Pharmacy and electronics raise QA/refund stakes (expiry/returnability) vs groceries.  ￼
	•	Industry norms: All major rivals trumpet 10-min; differentiation tilts to trust & clarity rather than sheer speed.  ￼

⸻

Appendix: policies & references (for teardown footnotes)
	•	Zepto Terms (refunds): prepaid → source; COD → Zepto Cash; TAT ≤7 business days.  ￼
	•	Membership shift: Pass → Daily reported Apr 2025; private label → margin narrative.  ￼
	•	Play Store snapshot: Zepto 4.7/100M+, BigBasket 4.8/100M+, Swiggy app 4.3/100M+.  ￼
	•	Return policy benchmarks: BigBasket “return at delivery/within window”; Instamart 24-hour typical per explainers; Blinkit damaged/wrong accepted.  ￼

⸻

Devil’s-advocate notes (to stress-test your mental model)
	•	You’re assuming “speed” is the edge. Data suggests trust clarity (fees/refunds/quality) is now the battleground; speed is commoditized. If we optimize further for speed at the expense of transparency, we may grow DAU but kill LTV.
	•	You’re treating fee experiments as tactical. They’re core to unit economics; if not made transparent, they create a systemic trust deficit that CRM can’t patch.
	•	You’re underweighting compliance & category risk. Pharmacy/packaged foods raise regulatory & QA exposure; a single incident can nuke cohorts.

⸻

(Optional) Field-notes checklist to gather while you test
	•	App version; city/area; account state (non-member vs member).
	•	Payment methods shown; refund options offered in-flow.
	•	Screenshots: cart confirm total; final invoice; fees drawer; substitution prompt; refund tracker; push/SMS timeline.
	•	Picker chat availability; store banner (if auto-switched); ETA promised vs delivered (timestamps).
	•	Any membership upsell copy, cart promos, minimum order nudges.
